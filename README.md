## Why I Use My Own Repository

I intend to use AzuraCast with modifications (I only require the AutoDJ feature). For quick adaptability and security, I know precisely what's been done here. Using repositories from other sites would necessitate verifying their changes. I'm not fond of unforeseen tasks, so understand that I can only guarantee this approach. However, integrating this into the default repository is straightforward. I don't believe the developers would want this outside their Docker setup.

## Installation (Latest Stable 0.19.1)

Copy and paste the entire line into your CLI.

```
mkdir /root/azuracast_installer && cd /root/azuracast_installer && git clone https://github.com/ashd0wn/AzuraCast-Ubuntu.git . && git checkout 0.19.1 && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh -i
```

Post-installation, verify everything functions correctly. If you come across issues tied to this installer, please report them here and refrain from troubling the AzuraCast developers with problems specific to this repository.

## How to Upgrade from 0.18.6 to 0.19.1?

The prior installer doesn't have an upgrade routine. You must first update the installer itself.

```
rm -rf /root/azuracast_installer && mkdir -p /root/azuracast_installer && cd /root/azuracast_installer && git clone https://github.com/scysys/AzuraCast-Ubuntu.git . && git checkout 0.19.1 && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh --upgrade
```

## Installation (Latest Rolling Release)

Copy and paste the entire line into your CLI.

```
mkdir /root/azuracast_installer && cd /root/azuracast_installer && git clone https://github.com/scysys/AzuraCast-Ubuntu.git . && git checkout main && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh --install_rrc
```

After installation, ensure everything is operational. If you identify any installer-related issues, report them here without involving the AzuraCast developers with issues specific to this repository.

## How to Upgrade from a Rolling Release?

It's not as straightforward as it was with Docker. If the developers introduce new dependencies, issues will arise. However, if changes are only within the panel, there should be no problems. If you're not comfortable with CLI, stick with the Stable Release from this repo.

```
rm -rf /root/azuracast_installer && mkdir -p /root/azuracast_installer && cd /root/azuracast_installer && git clone https://github.com/scysys/AzuraCast-Ubuntu.git . && git checkout rolling && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh --upgrade_rrc
```

## Tested With

- OVH
- Hetzner
- Digitalocean

I conduct automatic tests with these three hosts for each version. Just because it's Ubuntu 22.04 LTS doesn't imply all hosting providers are standardized with their images. If errors arise, open an issue with the logs.

## Good to Know

- I currently run it error-free on VPS systems with 1 vCPU and 2 GB RAM.
- I've modified the original [php.ini](/web/php/php.ini) that comes with AzuraCast [here](https://github.com/AzuraCast/AzuraCast/blob/main/util/docker/web/php/php.ini.tmpl). You can revert it to its original state or use some of the predefined templates [here](/web/php). Bear in mind, these configurations are based on my knowledge. Always verify any changes yourself before using these templates.
