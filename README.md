## Why I used my own repository for this

Personally, I plan to use AzuraCast in a modified way (I only need the AutoDJ feature). I need a fast way to react to changes and make modifications, and the most important reason is security. I know what I have done here. If I use the repository on other sites, I will have to check what has been changed. I dislike unplanned work, so please understand that I can only ensure this in this way. However, it is easy to add this to the default repository. Personally, I don't feel that this is something that the developers want outside of their Docker business.

## How to install

Just one line for you.

```
mkdir /root/azuracast_installer && cd /root/azuracast_installer && git clone https://github.com/ashd0wn/AzuraCast-Ubuntu.git . && git checkout 0.17.6 && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh -i
```

After installation, make sure that everything is working. If you encounter any issues related to the installer, please report them directly here and do not disturb the AzuraCast developers with errors that are related to this repository.

## Tested with
- OVH
- Hetzner
- Digitalocean

I'll run automatic tests with these 3 Hosters on every version. Ubuntu 22.04 LTS does not mean that some hosters outside are doing their own business with their images. Whatever. If you encounter an error, just open an issue with some logs.

## Good to Know

- Actually im using it without errors in VPS Systems with 1 vCPU and 2 GB Ram.
- I'll change the original [php.ini](/web/php/php.ini) that is shipped with AzuraCast [here](https://github.com/AzuraCast/AzuraCast/blob/main/util/docker/web/php/php.ini.tmpl). If you want, you can change it yourself to its original or use some of the predefined templates [here](/web/php). Keep in mind that I edited these configs just based on my knowledge. So don't trust what I've done there and always check yourself before using any of these templates.

## Future
- Add upgrade process
- We need more?
